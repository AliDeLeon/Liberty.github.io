				<h1 class="w3-text-shadow">PRACTICE AREAS</h1>
				<p>The Law Office of Maaria Mahmood specializes in handling complex and routine US immigration law matters. We specialize in K-1 fiancé visas, DACA, TPS, green card and citizenship/naturalization applications. Below are some of our other practice areas:</p>
			<div class="w3-col m3 w3-border-right">
			 	<h3>Family Based Immigration</h3>
			 	<ol class="w3-left-align " type="a">
			 		<li>US Immigration law allows US Citizens and US permanent Residents to Sponsor close family members to obtain permanent residence. US immigration divides family applications into two groups 1)immediate relatives and 2)Preference based categories.</li>
			 		<li>Immediate Relatives include:
			 			<ol class="w3-left-align" type="i">
			 				<li>spouses of US citizens,</li>
			 				<li>parents of US citizens at least 21 years of age, and</li>
			 				<li>the children of US citizens where the child is under the age of 21.</li>
			 			</ol>
			 		</li>
			 		<li>Immediate Relatives have an unlimited number of green cards. Immediate relatives who entered the US legally can apply to have their green card applications adjudicated in the US rather than having to go abroad, even if there are many years of unlawful presence</li>
			 		<li>Preference based categories include:
			 			<ol class="w3-left-align" type="i">
			 				<li>Unmarried sons and daughters of US Citizens</li>
			 				<li>Spouses and children (under 21) of Permanent Residents</li>
			 				<li>Unmarried sons and daughters (Over 21) or Permanent Residents</li>
			 				<li>Married sons and daughters of US Citizens</li>
			 				<li>Brother and sisters of US citizens</li>
			 			</ol>
		 			<li>Preference based categories have a limited number of green cards available per year. It has resulted into a long waiting period that stretches into many years.</li>
			 		</li>
			 		<li>Prior immigration violations such as unlawful presence, fraud or a deport order can impact your eligibility. However, often there are waivers available to remedy a prior immigration violation. It is critical to consult with an experienced immigration attorney.</li>
			 	</ol>
		  	</div>

			    <h3>Waivers-Unlawful Presence and Fraud</h3>
			 	<ol class="w3-left-align" type="a">
			 		<li>Prior immigration violations such as unlawful presence, deportation order and fraud impact an individuals’ eligibility for a visa. Unlawful presence and fraud are a common obstacle to legal immigration for most applicants.</li>
			 		<li><strong>Unlawful Presence (601A Waiver):</strong>  Unlawful presence is residing in the US without status. There are exceptions that stop the accrual of unlawful presence without necessarily providing status to an individual. Generally, if you have been unlawfully present in the US more than 6 months, upon departure you trigger a 3-year-bar for re-entry and if you have more than 1 year of unlawful presence, you will trigger a 10-year bar to rentry. The law often requires that you leave the US to get legal status at the US embassy in your home country. For example, if you marry a US citizen and enter through the border, you will be required to leave the United States to get legal status through your spouse. You will require the grant of an Unlawful presence (601-A) waiver, based on hardship to a qualifying relative who is a parent or spouse. You will receive an approval before you depart.</li>
			 		<li><strong>Fraud Waiver (601 Waiver):</strong>  False statements or fraudulent documents in your immigration history can result in a finding of visa fraud. There is a fraud waiver (601 waiver) available to remedy some immigration fraud. It is based on hardship to a parent or spouse who is a US citizen or permanent resident. This is different than a fraud waiver if you are a permanent resident and placed in removal proceedings.</li>
			 		<li><strong>Prior Deportations:</strong>  In some cases it is possible to apply for a waiver to pardon a deportation order, or apply for a motion to reopen and lift it.</li>

				  	<h3>Asylum, Withholding of Removal and Convention Against Torture</h3>
				 	<ol class="w3-left-align" type="a">
					    <li>US immigration law provides protection for individuals fleeing persecution in their home country.</li>
					    <br>
					    <li>Asylum is a legal protection provided by US immigration law to a person who can demonstrate a “well-founded fear of persecution” based on race, religion, nationality, political opinion, or membership in a particular social group. You must file your application for asylum within one year of entering the United States, unless there are a change of circumstance after the one year deadline or there are extraordinary circumstances that caused the delay. A grant in asylum will allow certain family members to receive asylee status. You and your family members can apply for your legal permanent residence and subsequently citizenship.</li>
					    <br>
					    <li>Witholding of Removal, like asylum is based on a well-founded fear of persecution. Witholding of Removal does not have a one-year filing deadline. However, there is a higher burden of proof than with asylum.  Unlike with Asylum, Witholding of Removal does not allow you to petition for your family members nor allow you to apply for permanent residence and citizenship. A grant of Witholding of Removal is a removal order that the government has withheld, and will not enforce against you. It allows you remain in the United States with work authorization.</li>

				 	<ol class="w3-left-align" type="a">
					    <li>Non-citizens, including permanent residents can be ordered deported or removed from the United States for various immigration violations. Removal defense is extensive and complex. Forms of relief available vary drastically depending upon your immigration history. It is critical to consult with an experienced Immigration Attorney if you are placed in removal proceedings! There are various waivers and forms of relief available to individuals in removal proceedings.</li>
					    <br>
					    <li>If you do not have any status there are forms of relief available to you such as asylum, cancellation of removal, family based petitions and more.</li>
					    <br>
					    <li>If you are a permanent resident you can be placed in removal proceeding if you committed fraud or commit fraud to obtain an immigration benefit. Certain criminal convictions can result in a permanent resident being placed in removal proceedings, as well. There are waivers available to pardon certain criminal convictions and fraud. Waivers involving criminal convictions and fraud are extremely complicated. It is critical to have an experienced immigration attorney, preferably working with your criminal attorney even before a plea is entered.</li>
